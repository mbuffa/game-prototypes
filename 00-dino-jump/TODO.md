# TODO
* [ ] Make a smooth jump (use cos/sine?)
* [ ] Replace all macroquad prelude imports with scoped imports
* [ ] Draw a background/foreground with two levels of parallax
  * Draw a slowly moving background (maybe like some mountains?)
  * Draw a more quickly moving foreground (like dots in sand)
* [ ] Add sounds (yeah)
* [ ] Tune the pacing so that it starts slowly and then speeds up
