# Turrets

This is a simple 2D game prototype focused on Turrets, written in Rust and using Macroquad.

## Running it
* Checkout assets (committed in a separate branch that will never be merged, to avoid the git history to grow):
```
./checkout-assets.sh # Or ./checkout-assets.bat depending on your system.
```
* And then:
```
cargo run --release
```
